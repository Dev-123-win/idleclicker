Highest CPM (₹120 vs ₹50 for interstitials)
User-initiated (better engagement)
Higher completion rates (95%+ vs 70% for interstitials)

How to Maximize:

Make cooldown bypass require rewarded videos (not just interstitials)
Energy refills exclusively through rewarded videos
Daily bonuses require rewarded video to claim
Leaderboard entry requires rewarded videos
Mission reward doublers through rewarded videos

Target: 60% of total ad revenue from rewarded videos
7.3.2 Ad Mediation Strategy
Primary Ad Network: Google AdMob
Backup Networks (waterfall):

Facebook Audience Network (if AdMob fails)
Unity Ads (second backup)
AppLovin (final backup)

Waterfall Logic:

Request ad from AdMob first
If no fill within 3 seconds → Request from Facebook
If no fill within 3 seconds → Request from Unity
If no fill → Display "Ad unavailable" message

Purpose: Maximize fill rate (target 95%+) and CPM
7.3.3 Ad Quality Filtering
Blocked Categories:

Gambling/Betting apps
Adult content
Misinformation/fake news
Violent games (graphic content)
Cryptocurrency/trading apps (user protection)

Why: Maintain app reputation, protect users, comply with Google Play policies

Test Variables:

Ad cooldown lengths (2 min vs 3 min vs 4 min)
Rewarded video reward amounts (30 vs 40 vs 50 energy)
Interstitial frequency (every 500 vs 750 taps)
Mission checkpoint ad placement (early vs late)

Success Metrics:

Revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU)
