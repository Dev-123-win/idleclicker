I already setup the flutter project i just need you to build an material 3 physics based interation like IOS apps UI and UX i am using firebase free tier and cloud workers free tier - be optmized limits of those and i won't use firebase functions and firebase FCM and Remote config also . I just need an app where users can tap to earn my app virtual coins @AppCoin.png , and withdraw that coin to real money . 1000coins =1 indian rupees and we provide missions like 1000 taps if the users completes it he earns that much coins and we are still only making making this game for indian users only so i will introduce ads admob rewarded ads and interstial ads in between those taps so i can make profit and give the user real out of that profit so i would 65% of the total revenue and remaining 35% will be for user , in india ecpm is quite still low consider ecpm as 50-55 rupess and also for interstitial also keep the ecpm low so even though the cpm goes we will be in profit ,this is the major things the minimum withdrawl is 100000(100rupees) and we only give ,missions once a month like reset the missions that already exist or when the 100rupee withdraw is done . the game mission should be like this starting the users shout earn approx 50 ruppees easily by watch less ads but still ads need to cover the given 50 rupees but after the 50 rupees the rest 50 rupees earning should be hard like showing more ads and more taps like that . only one account per mobile strict rule and only when internet is connected does the users can use the app and login (auth-email and password only ) and withdraw and referral (referrer get 2k coins and referred user gets 5k coins ) everything should work instantly and still optmized free tier firebase and cloud workers and handle the withdraw when withdraw things and upi details enter to withdraw and referral to search the referrer detals and coin award both free tier optmized . now the main the things the data goes through the backend to firestore okay the cloud workers backend works as cloud functions and timer or any other things needed okay . this is the main part the coins earned and other data except the auth , referral and withdraw , all the remaining will only go through backend to database at a specific time like in a day those data will only go at 3 hours intervals but the data's are batched and kept in backend okay . so like local first then database type okay -- if you understood create dedicated screens like home splash auth(login register and forgot password) , referral withdraw and profile screen and fAQ and any other screen that are mandatory for the app to publish in free appstores like amazon appstore xiami app store and any other free stores . also introduce native ads , banner ads and app open ads ( but they don't give users any money okay ) . create unique animations for splash screen and tapping thing and other where needed. implement notifications (lutter_local_notifications), use hive instead of shared preferences . BEST UI/UX in the flutter mobile history , use native ads template format to load the native ads not the kotlin or android files add type ------ did you understood what type of app i am trying to tell you to build if you create an detailed plan as mentioned by me all the thinks should be as they are mentioned and create an plan with all the phase detailed and structed mention in be as clear as you can .
